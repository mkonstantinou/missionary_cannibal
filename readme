Homework 1

Assumptions:
    1. Missionaries and cannibals are not "left alone" until the boat leaves the shore that they are on.
       For example, if there are 3 cannibals and two missionaries on the right side of the river and the boat 
       has not taken any passengers back to the left side, the solution does not fail.  It only fails when 
       the boat leaves the right shore  with the missionaries outnumbered.

To run:
    ./missionary_cannibal
